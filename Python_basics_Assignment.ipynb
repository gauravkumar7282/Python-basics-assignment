        "Q1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is a high level programming language which is use for interact with computer.\n",
        "- It is a formal language for creating instruction for a computer to follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it is popular?**\n",
        "- This language is so popular because it is easy to learn and read.\n",
        "- It is widely used in the industry (mostly in data industry).\n",
        "- It have lots of libraries available.\n",
        "- It is used as many way such as : Fronted, Backend, Data Analysis, Automation, Image processing, etc.\n",
        "- It have huge active community.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "- It is translator that convert our code in computer understanding language.\n",
        "- It also check our code line by line for Execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "- The predefine words can hold a special meaning and have some specific purpose.\n",
        "- We can get every keyword by code\n",
        "      { help('key words')}.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "- Yes, Keyword can be used as a variable name by assigning it as a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "- Mutablity in Python means the value which is assign can be modify after creation.\n",
        "- The mutable variables are :- Lists, Sets and Dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6 Why are lists are  mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "- Lists are mutable because it can be changed after creation, And tuples are immutable because it can't be changed after creation. If you want to make changes in tuples you have to create new one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "- \"==\" its stand for (is equal to =) and its mean that the value is equal.\n",
        "- \"is\" it means the value is available in object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "- There are two types of logical operators : 'AND' and 'OR'.\n",
        "- 'AND' if the both value is True then it return value as True, ANd if the any of the value is False it returns False.\n",
        "- 'OR' if the both value is False then it return value as False, ANd if the any of the value is True it returns True.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- The process of changing data type of the value/object is known as type casting.\n",
        "- It is used because of mismatch between the data type of value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- Implicit Type casting: The Data type that can be uderstand or can be execute without changing it data type is known as imlicit type casting.\n",
        "- Explicit Type casting: The data type that cannot be understand or can't be execute without changing its data type is known as explicit type casting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "- The purpose of contitional statement is to help you to add condition to the code to take decision based on precondition.\n",
        "- the conditional statement used to take decision on different level such as: single condition, multiple condition and on something else.\n",
        "- There are four type of conditional statement : (if, if else, if elif, nested else if)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "- The elif statement required when you have more than two condition.\n",
        "- It use to apply multiple condition.\n",
        "- Syntax:-\n",
        "if (condition):\n",
        "  (block of code)\n",
        "elif(condition):\n",

        "  (block of code)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "- **For loop** :- it repeat a process or a set of instruction over a sequence of element.\n",
        "- syntax :- for variable in sequence:\n",
        "              (block of code)\n",
        "- **While loop** :- Repeatdy executed a block of code until a condition is met.\n",

        "          execute block of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "- While loop is more suitable in the scenario in which there is no fixed number of range, It execute the code until the condition is true."
